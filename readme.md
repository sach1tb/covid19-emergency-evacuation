# COVID19 during an emergency evacuation

The results in this study [1] were obtained in two steps:

## Run an updated version of the social force model

Run different scenarios using an updated version of PanicPackage code from [2]. Within this: 
1. Create a subdirectory called 'dump'
2. update the sd_lib.c file according to the diff file sd_lib-diff.txt and compile the application
3. update the sd.par file to assign different parameter values
4. parse_files.sh to have multiple runs store datafiles into the 'dump' folder

## Run analysis script post_analysis_sd.m 

This script has the following functions each of which point to the data in the dump folder
1. % coarse_sd3(); % 1 coarse the dataset so that we sample at 0.01 s
2. % get_evac_times(); % 2 extract evacuation times for 90% of the crowd
3. % replay_a_trial(); % for verification
4. % plot_traj(); % for verification
5. % calculate_distmat(); % 3 this takes time! go for a coffee break!
6. % calculate_exposure_from_IA(16); % 4 takes the tau value as input
7. composite_plot(); % 5 draw the composite plot for paper
